# FileToPNG
A program that can both convert an arbitrary file into a PNG image and convert the file back to its original format, with its metadata, name, and file extension intact.

To use it, just download the source and compile Main.java as a Java application.

I've also written a [post](https://ozanerhansha.github.io/filetopng/) about the project, detailing interesting patterns found amongst similar file types as well as the consequences of representing information this way.
